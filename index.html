    <div><h2>Day 1 in learning how to code... again.</h2></div>
    <p>freeCodeCamp is a great resource. I'm ripping through the basic HTML as I've done
        this type of course work several times over, over the years. Can I dedicate the next year
        to continuing to learn web development so I can work form anywhere?
    </p>

    <div><H2>Day 2</H2>
    <p>Continuing through HTML basics. Went through the Build a Cat Photo App workshop. Covered headings, paragraphs
        images, links and list both ordered and unordered and more. Sections were covered briefly in this workshop.</p>
    <p>I also completed the Lab which was building a Recipe page. Took roughly an hour. Could have been quicker for me 
        if I didn't have to click on the check code button twice for everyline of code</p>
    </div>
    <div><a href="freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a></div>
    <div><p>I am going to start the next lecture on HTML Fundamentals while I'm waiting for 9am to get here. In which case I'll be heading out the door for 
        breakfast and head out for the day to begin knocking on doors and signing people up for a fibre optic drop to there house. Gotta pay the bills.
        <strong>Thought</strong>, maybe after a year of traveling selling fibre to homeowners. There could be oppurtunity to sell from home for someone like <a href="www.jobber.com">Jobber</a>
        I don't remember learning about OG in meta descriptions before. Facebook introduced this in 2010.

        <h2>Day 3</h2>
        <p>working on a lab. short on time today. Booked customers to early in the morning. I'm suppose to work later into the evening 7-8 pm. 
            This is going to make for a very long day indeed. Touched on Figure and figcaption today as we built a travel webpage.

    <h2>Day 4</h2>
    <p>Today is to be audio, audio player, loop, boolean. Source elements will help the browswers basically work. Poster attribute only works with the vidio element.
        Start using file formats with WEBP or AVIF rather than JPG and PNG. Never compress a JPG.
        Gotta comment that the internet speeds in this hotel are poor. They remind me of the days of dialup. Click on link, walk away, hope it loads
        before you get back to your computer. Matter of fact, as I'm typing I'm still waiting for this short video to download enough to see the player.
        I just read the transcript instead. Yeesh.
        Lesson continues from images and video formats. And has landed on SVG. Lesson suggests opening an SVG with a text editor and play with the code.
        Continuing on to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lecture-working-with-media/what-are-replaced-elements" target="_blank">
            replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an external resource rather than by CSS itself</a>.  img, iframe, video elements are examples.

    <h2>Day 5</h2>
    <p>Working with state of the link. :link - default, :visited - visited, :hover - hovering over and :active - activated. There is a fifth
        freecode camp did not go into detail about in the video <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus" target="_default">:focused</a>
         - used on elements like a form input to be focused typically triggers when the user
        clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's Tab key.
    </p>
    <p>The MDN docs reference these links as CSS pseudo-class elements. Matching every unvisted anchor or image map area element</p>
    <p>< !--This is an HTML comment.-- > For future reference. I forgot how to use the comment - remove spaces to close < -- </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/review-basic-html/basic-html-review">freeCodeCamp HTML basic reference page</a></p>
    <P>Finished the basic HTML in freeCodeCamp by writing the test. Hit 100% first try through. I did look at the MDN Docs about Open Graph Data.
        So I coompleted 85 steps in 5 days. Moving on to Semantic HTML.

    <h2>Day 6</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Todays course work starts with the difference between <i lang="en">i with lang attribute</i> versus using the emphasis <em>element</em>.Quoting freecodecamp you should use the <strong>strong</strong> element in stead <bold>b element</bold> as it is a semantic element the emphasizes text that is crucial or urgent.</p>
    </div>        
    <div>
        Moving into description lists.
        <dl>
            <dt>HTML</dt>
            <dd>Hypertext Markup Language</dd>
            <dt>CSS</dt>
            <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Simple enough, terms with definitions would be a good use case. Recipes would be able to use this as well.</p>
